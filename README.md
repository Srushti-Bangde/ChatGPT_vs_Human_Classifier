# Text Classification Project

## Introduction

This project involves the creation and analysis of a dataset comprising questions from Quora, along with human-generated answers and responses from ChatGPT. The dataset, named 'Dataset.csv,' contains 150 rows and 4 columns (id, Question, Human, ChatGPT), where 'Human' represents human-generated answers, and 'ChatGPT' contains responses from the ChatGPT model.

## Dataset Creation

The dataset was generated by posing questions to Quora, recording human answers, and obtaining responses from ChatGPT for the same questions. This resulted in a curated dataset that serves as the foundation for text classification tasks.

## Text Classification using Naive Bayes

A text classification model was implemented using a Naive Bayes classifier to determine whether each question in the dataset was answered by a human or ChatGPT. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and a TF-IDF vectorizer was applied to represent textual data numerically. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the transformed training data and evaluated on the test set, including accuracy metrics.

## Text Classification using Hello-SimpleAI/HC3 and DistilBERT

Additionally, a text classification solution was implemented using Hello-SimpleAI/HC3 and DistilBERT. The DistilBERT model was trained for classification on the dataset, and an interactive user interface was created for ease of use using Gradio.

## Original Work

All aspects of this project, including dataset creation, model implementation, and user interface development, represent original work. No code or ideas were borrowed from existing GitHub repositories.

## Analysis of GPT Answers

For a deeper analysis of ChatGPT-generated answers, a GitHub repository was utilized. The analysis focused on comparing GPT responses with human-generated answers.
